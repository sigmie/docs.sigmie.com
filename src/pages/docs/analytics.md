Analytics and data play a crucial part in almost everything; you can use the analytics section in the Sigmie application to see metrics about your Searches and your users.

## Metrics

In the Analytics section in the Sigmie UI, you will find various metrics about your application Searches.
Each metric also has a trend indicator that compares the values of the current time range with those of the same previous range.

To clarify, if your time range is "**Last Month**", this trend compares the retrieved values with the "**Month before the last**".

### Total Searches

The "Total Searches" metric shows how many Search requests were made during the specified time range.

## Scoreboards

### Popular Queries

The "Popular Queries" show the Queries that your users typed the most.
This is useful to understand "how" your users use the Searchbox that you gave them to make adjustments accordingly.

### Popular Documents

The "Popular Documents" shows the ids of the Documents that are more often retrieved by a Search.
This scoreboard gives you an overview of the demand and the good-performing products. So may, for example, want to raise a small price on these goods.

### Top Queries without results

The "Top Queries without results" are the Queries that the users type more often, and no results are returned.

For an Online-Shop this would indicate a product that may be missing from your Shop.

Suppose the word "Nutella" appears there. In that case, it means many users come to your Shop wanting to order a "Nutella", but it isn't available.
