Per-application Billing.

---


Each account has a **Team**. You can invite members of your Team to collaborate with you. Team members will have **read** access to **all your projects**. This allows organizations to have more than 1 user managing their projects.

We offer per-application billing. Each of your applications needs a valid subscription on its own for you to access it. You can still always log in to the application to manage your settings, even **without** an active subscription.

To manage your applications' billing settings, go to your settings page, and select the project under the **Projects** tab.

## Refunds

- If you were just charged for your next month of service, but you meant to cancel, we're happy to refund that extra charge.

## Receipts

In the Billing section, you can find the receipts for all the transactions from our application. Click on "View Receipt" to open the Receipt page from [Paddle](https://paddle.com/). There you can download your receipt and edit your invoice address.

## Business Receipts

In many cases, you may want to add your company's VAT number on your receipt. You can visit your project's billing section under Settings > Projects > Manage. Click on "View Receipt" to open your receipt and add your VAT number.
