description: Ignore common language words.

In every language, there are words like "the" and "that", that instead of
helping to find the right match, they lead us to false positives.

Many words that a user may type in a search field can be confusing when looking for the perfect match for a query.

Index Stopwords are defined in your Index settings in the "Language" tab.

In the English language, some examples are the words “and” and “but”. Taking those words into consideration when searching may lead to false positives instead of more accurate results.

There are also various predefined stopword lists for [ several languages ](/docs/indices/languages).

The Stopwords feature is on the **Index** level. You can view and edit the Stopwords list for your index in the **Language** tab in your index settings.
