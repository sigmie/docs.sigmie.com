## What is Sigmie ?

Sigmie application is hosted Search solution for any application.

 Having an intelligent search is much
more than matching one word in thousands of documents. 

To find the perfect match for a
Query you have to take into consideration things like the query language,
typos that ther user may have made and more.


Sigmie takes this pain away and provides a user interface to make managing your search easy.
