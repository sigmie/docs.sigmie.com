# Billing

We offer a per-project billing. Each of your projects needs a valid subscription on its own, for you to access it. You can still always log in to the application, even without any active subscription, to manage your settings. 

To manage your project’s billing settings, go to your settings page, and select the project under the **Projects** tab.

## Receipts
In the Billing section, you can find the receipts for all the transactions from our application. Click on “View Receipt” to open the Receipt page from [Paddle](https://paddle.com/). There you can download your receipt and edit your invoice address. 

## Business Receipts
In many cases, you may want to add your company's VAT number on your receipt. You can do this by visiting your project’s billing section under Settings > Projects > Manage. There click on “View Receipt” to open your receipt and add your VAT number.
